# Armstrong Numbers
A number a is an Armstrong Number or narcissistic number if it is equal
to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Example:
a.) 153 is an armstrong number. 
```
(1^3) + (5^3) + (3^3) = 153
```
b.) 407 is also an armstrong number.
```
(4^3) + (0^3) + (7^3) = 407
```

## Task
Write a program that will display all Armstrong number from 100 to 1000
